Program can be run using : node index.js

Before that, make sure taht you have installed nodejs environment to your device.

You can run the application using VS Code's "Code Runner" extension without using the command mentioned above.

If you don't want to use any extension, you can just hit the "Debug Console" button in VS Code and click 'Run and Debug' button at the left side bar. Again, you will need to install NodeJs for this to work.
