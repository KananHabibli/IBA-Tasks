The program can be run using: node index.js

Before that, make sure that you have installed the nodejs environment on your device.

You can run the application using VS Code's "Code Runner" extension without using the command mentioned above.

If you don't want to use any extension, you can just hit the "Debug Console" button in VS Code and click the 'Run and Debug' button at the left sidebar. Again, you will need to install NodeJs for this to work.

The program sorts the given array that contains the positions of the cars in a parking lot. Then it will go through the array to determine the minimal roof size that can be installed for the garage that satisfies the requirements.
